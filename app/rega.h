/*
 * REGA Alam and Test
 * ==================
 *
 * This function sends out a fixed ZVEI tone sequence for testing or alarm purposes for the Alpine REGA alarm channel.
 * Further information: https://www.rega.ch/en/our-missions/sites-and-infrastructure/emergency-radio
 *
 * There are two REGA ACTIONS: Test and Alarm.
 * The Test action sends out a fixed ZVEI tone sequence for testing purposes.
 * The Alarm action sends out a fixed ZVEI tone sequence for alarm purposes.
 * 
 * These actions can be assigned to a key in the settings menu.
 * 
 * The Test/Alarm function will perform the following actions:
 * - Set the radio configuration to the REGA frequency, CTCSS, FM, full power etc.
 * - Start transmitting
 * - Wait 100ms to allow the radio to switch to transmit mode and stabilize the transmitter
 * - Send out the ZVEI tone sequence
 * - Wait 100ms to allow the radio to finish transmitting
 * - Set the radio back to receive mode
 * 
 * The REGA frequency is 161.300 Mhz
 *
 * The ZVEI tone squence for alarm is: 21414
 * The ZVEI tone squence for test is: 21301 
 *
 * The two tone sequences are hardcoded in two arrays
